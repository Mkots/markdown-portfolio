I am a 4-year-experienced AQA Engineer and use **JS\TS** in my work, mostly **Playwright** with **CodeceptJS**. Generally, I stand by GithubFlow methodology combining it with Agile\Kanban.  
Usually, I joined the teams that hadn't had test automation processes, so my responsibility also was to establish the testing process. Because of my experience, knowledge, and participation in community discussions, I was able to help companies reach their quality standards and improve them over time.
In addition, I work with **Cypress** (writing e2e and component tests for React interactive learning application), **Jest** (setting up unit tests for several applications including **CI** via GithubActions, and reporting via Testomat.io). 
Moreover, I compiled an automation system using Playwright, CodeceptJS, and Testomat. I created a test framework with a lot of helpers and PageObjects, which provides our team a flexible system for quicker test writing.
Dealing with **TestRTC** to test performance and quality video calls is also one of my track records.
As a Senior QA I work with **SQL**, regularly writing cross-table queries with aggregations to test payments or schedules. 
Concerning team management, I have experience in leading a two-member team, which implemented automation from unit to integration testing.
